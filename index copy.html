						<p>I could be the one or your new addiction<br>
							It's all in my head, but I want non-fiction<br>
							I don't want the world, but I'll take this city<br>
							Who can blame a girl? Call me hot, not pretty<br>
							Baby, do you like this beat? (Na-na, na-na, na)<br>
							I made it so you'd dance with me (na-na, na-na, na)<br>
							It's like a hundred ninety-nine degrees (na-na, na-na, na)<br>
							When you're doing it with me, doing it with me<br>
							H-O-T-T-O-G-O, snap and clap and touch your toes<br>
							Raise your hands, now body roll, dance it out, you're hot to go<br>
							H-O-T-T-O-G-O, snap and clap and touch your toes<br>
							Raise your hands, now body roll, H-O-T-T-O-G-O</p>
					</div>
				    <div class="grid-2"><h3>Good Luck, Babe!</h3>
						<p>It's fine, it's cool<br>
							You can say that we are nothing, but you know the truth<br>
							And guess I'm the fool<br>
							With her arms out like an angel through the car sunroof<br>
							I don't wanna call it off<br>
							But you don't wanna call it love<br>
							You only wanna be the one that I call "baby"<br>
							You can kiss a hundred boys in bars<br>
							Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling<br>
							You can say it's just the way you are<br>
							Make a new excuse, another stupid reason<br>
							Good luck, babe (well, good luck), well, good luck, babe (well, good luck)<br>
							You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling</p>
					</div>
				    <div class="grid-2"><h3>Femininomenon</h3>
						<p>Stuck in the suburbs, you're folding his laundry<br>
							Got what you wanted, so stop feeling sorry<br>
							Crying at the nail salon<br>
							I'm so sick of online love<br>
							I don't understand, why can't any man<br>
							Hit it like<br>
							Get it hot<br>
							Make a bitch<br>
							It's a fem<br>
							Hit it like<br>
							Get it hot<br>
							Make a bitch<br>
							It's a-, dude, can you play a song with a fucking beat?<br>
							Hit it like rom-pom-pom-pom (hit it like)<br>
							Get it hot like Papa John (get it hot)<br>
							Make a bitch go on and on (make a bitch)<br>
							It's a femininomenon (it's a fem)<br>
							Hit it like rom-pom-pom-pom (hit it like)<br>
							Get it hot like Papa John (get it hot)<br>
							Make a bitch go on and on (make a bitch)<br>
							It's a femininomenon (it's a fem)</p>
